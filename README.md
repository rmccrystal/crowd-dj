# Crowd DJ
Crowd DJ is an open source DJ system which selects songs based on which songs are most popular throughout the crowd. When a new party is created, users can go to the website using the party URL and add new songs to the queue. By default, songs that are newly added will have a score of zero. These songs may be upvoted or downvoted by users depending on wheather or not they want the song to be played. Once a song has been played, the score will be set to -1 so most songs will not be replayed unless there are no other songs available to play. Songs will be played through a YouTube iFrame and queued through YouTube URLs or a YouTube search.
